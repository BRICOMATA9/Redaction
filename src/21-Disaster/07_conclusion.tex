% The emergence of new wireless communication services and demand for Big Data processing in real-time poses new architectural and radio resource management challenges.
% This chapter surveys research on emerging wireless communication technologies for effective disaster monitoring and management systems.
% WSN and IoT stand as a major enabler for enhanced disaster monitoring and management systems.
% In this chapter,
% 	limitations of two major IoT standards (LoRA and 4G LTE) are presented with some future research recommendations.
% It is concluded that future research should focus on developing artificial intelligence/machine learning driven more robust radio resource management strategies to enable optimized operations in real-time.
